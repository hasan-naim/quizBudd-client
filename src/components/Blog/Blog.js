          #1 What is the purpose of React Router?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-xl text-[#b5c8d6]">
          We use react-router to navigate different pages in our react app. We
          can render different components based on different routes in the URL.
          We can also fetch data for a specific route and pass them in the
          component then we can show them in the UI. By using react-router page
          wonâ€™t refresh when we go a different route every time.{" "}

          #2 How does context API work?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-xl text-[#b5c8d6] mb-4">
          Context API provides a way to pass data in the component tree without
          passing any props at each level. This way we can avoid props drilling.
          And we can pass any data, any function to any child component I mean
          in any component in the tree. The data provided by context is global.
          Any component in the tree can get the data.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl text-[#b5c8d6]">
          We can create a new context by using React.createContext and then we
          can wrap our component tree by using Context.Provider with value
          property. Then we can get the value anywhere in the component tree and
          use it.
